wrp_fetch(
  wrp_con,
  class = "~.*",
  labels = NULL,
  end = "ws:NOW",
  start = NULL,
  count = NULL,
  timespan = NULL,
  selector = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{wrp_con}{\link{wrp_connect} object.}

\item{class}{Selector for the GTS classes.
Can either be an exact match or a regular expression (the value should then start with a ~).}

\item{labels}{Map of labels selectors.
The key is the label name, the value a selector which can be an exact match or a regular expression
(the value should then start with a ~).}

\item{end}{Newest timestamp to consider when fetching datapoints.}

\item{start}{Oldest timestamp to consider when fetching datapoints.}

\item{count}{Maximum number of datapoints to fetch for each GTS. Incompatible with negative 'timespan'.}

\item{timespan}{Depth to consider when fetching the datapoints.
If the value is positive then it is interpreted as a duration in time units,
if it is negative then as the maximum number of datapoints to fetch.
If negative, incompatible with \code{count}.}

\item{selector}{A Geo Time Seriesâ„¢ selector with the syntax class{labels} where class is an exact match
or a regular expression starting with ~ and labels a comma separated list of labels selector
of the form name=exact or name~regexp.
Names and values must be percent URL encoded if needed.}

\item{selectors}{A list of GTS selectors, each with a syntax identical to that of 'selector'.}

\item{type}{Name of type to force for the GTS, either LONG, DOUBLE, BOOLEAN or STRING.}
}
\description{
The FETCH function interacts with the Warp 10 Storage Engine to retrieve data according to given criteria.

\section{Concerned Geo Time Series}{


FETCH selects Geo Time Series according to:
\itemize{
\item The selectors parameter, which is a list of selector.
\item If selectors is not found, FETCH uses the selector parameter which is a single selector.
\item If selector is not found, FETCH uses both class and labels parameters.
}
}

\section{Time window}{


FETCH begins from the newest value and stop when the oldest value is collected.
Thus, end must be defined in your request and defines the newest included value in your time window.
If end is anterior to your oldest value, the result will be empty (no Geo Time Series).
The span of the time window ending at end is then defined according to:
\itemize{
\item The timespan parameter.
\item If timespan is not defined, FETCH collects a maximum of count point.
\item If count is not defined, FETCH determines timespan with start.
If start is more recent than end, end and start are permuted internally.
Be careful, this means end is included but start is excluded from the time window.
