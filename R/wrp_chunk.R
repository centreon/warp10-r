#' Chunk
#'
#' The CHUNK is used to split a Geo Time Seriesâ„¢ into partial GTS.
#' The split operation is controlled by multiple parameters.
#' The series will be splitted in chunks, each chunks will form a new GTS,
#' with a label value corresponding to its first tick.
#'
#' @inheritParams documentation
#' @param last The end timestamp of the most recent split to consider.
#' @param width The width in time units of each chunk.
#' @param overlap An overlap duration (in time units) between chunks,
#'   this is useful when chunking a GTS to apply an algorithm which operates on a sliding window.
#' @param count The number of chunks to keep (starting from the last chunk).
#' @param label The label name of the label added by the split operation
#'   (with a value corresponding to the first tick of the chunk).
#' @param keep_empty If true empty chunks are kept.
